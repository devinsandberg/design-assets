# Contributing Guide

> **_NOTE:_** _We’re just getting started. While we appreciate any feedback, we’re not yet ready to accept public contributions._

Thank you for your help making this project and community as good as it can be. We strive to maintain a welcoming, inclusive space for all. All contributors, including commenters on issues, are expected to abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/mineral-ui/mineral-ui/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Here are a few things to help your contribution be fun and trouble-free.


## Submitting a Pull Request

We welcome pull requests from anyone, but before working on a large change, it is best to open an issue first to discuss it with the maintainers. You can also get a good overview of our current and planned work from our [Change Log](./changelog.md).

Please try to keep your PR as small and focused as possible, and don’t include more than one "UI widget" per PR. Big PRs are hard to review and are less likely to be accepted.

Since visually inspecting Sketch files is not supported by Github, please indicate the page and symbol name(s) to investigate.

For a PR to be accepted, it must fit within the overall look and feel of the library, utilize the theming mechanism provided in the [Theme Settings](https://github.com/mineral-ui/design-assets/blob/master/library/Mineral%20UI%20theme%20settings.sketch) Sketch file, and be associated with a PR for a Mineral UI component. The PR URI for the component must accompany the PR for the Sketch symbol(s) - see [Contributing](https://github.com/mineral-ui/mineral-ui/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). All authors must sign the [Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")](https://cla-assistant.io/mineral-ui/mineral-ui).
