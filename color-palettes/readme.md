# Color Palettes

Usage of the mineral UI color palettes in sketch requires the plugin https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes

## Setup

We suggest setting grade-60 (default) to your global colors, and loading in other color palettes as needed.

### Replacing global colors with mineral UI

1. After you've installed the plugin, go to Plugins > Sketch Palettes > Clear Palette
2. Select global or document palettes, for this example we will clear the global presets.
3. Select Plugins > Sketch Palettes > Load Palette
4. Select grade-60 (base) from the file explorer
5. In the source dropdown, select Global presets
6. Click Load
6. When you select an object and the color picker, you should now see the base mineralUI colors in your global selection.

### Replacing document colors with mineral UI

1. Repeat steps 1-4 from above, except on step two, clear document presets.
2. After selecting the file, ensure source is set to "Document Presets," and click load.
3. Now you should have your chosen color palettes in both the global and document.
