This is a testing ground for distribution of Sketch files, and design metadata.

2. [Shared sketch palettes](https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes)

### Importing your theme colors
1. Mineral comes with an array of supported color themes to select for your product. [Check this readme to import your theme colors](https://github.com/mineral-ui/design-assets/tree/master/color-palettes)
2. Once you've imported your theme palettes you may move on to the next section of setup.

## 2. Setting up your theme

*If your application color theme is MineralUI-blue, the following steps are unecessary and you may skip to section 3!"*

1. After you've downloaded the Mineral UI repository and imported your theme palettes, open the "Mineral theme UI settings" sketch file.
2. Open the "🎨 Color" page.
3. Where prompted to replace the color swatches with your theme colors you may replace each color with the theme you selected in the previous section.
    * You may use your imported palette to quickly replace the 10 colors on this page.

4. After you've replaced these ten colors, view the "✏️ Text styles" page.
5. In the right column of text, replace the color for each of text layer with the color base **60** of your theme. (do each individually)
6. As you update each of these layers don't forget to sync the text styles.
7. After you've updated all three of your text styles and synced them, go to Plugins > Shared Text Styles > Export text styles
5. Save the export file with name "mytheme-text-styles"
6. Save and close this sketch file.

### Icons

1. Now open the "Mineral UI icons" sketch file, in the top right corner it should have a button stating "Updates available." 2. Click this button and click update on the verification window.
3. Now all of your icons should be matching your theme color.
4. You may now save and close this file.

### Mineral UI utilities & Others

1. Open up the "Mineral UI utilities" sketch file.
2. Go to Plugins > Shared Text styles > Import text styles and select the file you exported earlier
3. Text styles on various symbols should now be updated.
3. In this file you will also see "Updates available," similar the last steps press this button and go ahead and update all symbols and styles.
4. Save and close this file
5. Open Mineral UI subomponents and repeat steps 1-4.
6. Open Mineral UI components and repeat steps 1-4.

Now you may create your own file and start using these files as a library.

## 3. Designing using the symbols

1. The symbols are pretty straight forward and organized in a way to allow you to quickly find related symbols.
2. Any symbols filed under "utilities" can be ignored as these are partial building blocks for the symbols you are actually using.
